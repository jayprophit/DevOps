### what is DevOps?

```markdown
|  Software Company   |
|----------|----------|
|Developers|Operations| 
```

Although, the software quality was improved.  We still had a lack of efficiency amoung the development team.  A typical software development team consists of Developers and Operations employees.  Let us see their job roles

```markdown
|A developer's Job is to develop        |    |The Operations team job is to test the code,       |
|applications and pass thier code to the|    |and provide feedback to developers in case of bugs.|
|operations team                        |    |if all gose well, the operations team uploads the  |
|                                       |    |code to the build servers                          |
|---------------------------------------|    |---------------------------------------------------|
|              Developer                |    |                     Operations                    |
```

```markdown
|           Developer              |      |         Operations          |
|----------------------------------|      |-----------------------------|
|The developer used to run the     | -->  |The operations when tried to |
|code on thier system, and then    |      |run the code on thier system,|
|forwards it to the operations team|      |it did not run!              |
```

```markdown
|           Developer          |      |         Operations        |
|------------------------------|      |---------------------------|
|But, the code runs fine on the| <--  |The operations team then   |
|developer's system and hence  |      |mark's this code as faulty,|
|they say "it is not my fault!"|      |and then forward's  this   |
|                              |      |feedback to back to the    |
|                              |      |developer                  |
```
